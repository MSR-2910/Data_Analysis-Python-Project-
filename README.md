## Key Findings

- Occupancy Rate by Room Category: Across room categories, the occupancy rates are consistently high. The Presidential Suite shows the highest occupancy rate at 59.30%, suggesting effective demand management and market segmentation strategies.
- Average Occupancy Rate per City: The average occupancy rates per city are: Bangalore 56.59%, Delhi 61.61%, Hyderabad 58.14%, and Mumbai 57.94%.
- Weekday vs. Weekend Occupancy: Weekends consistently exhibit higher occupancy rates compared to weekdays, indicating increased demand for accommodations during weekends.
- Revenue Realized per City: Mumbai leads in revenue realization, potentially due to robust demand or higher room rates. Efficient revenue management strategies appear to be implemented across all cities.

## Conclusion 
The project concludes that AtliQGrands has effectively managed demand and segmented markets, as evidenced by consistently high occupancy rates across room categories and cities.
